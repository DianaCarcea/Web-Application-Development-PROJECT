# ArP – Artwork Provenance

**Team:** ArtSynergy

## Project Overview
ArP is a semantic web platform for modeling, managing, and visualizing the provenance of artistic works.  
It integrates Linked Open Data sources such as **Wikidata**, **DBpedia**, and **Europeana**, with a focus on cultural heritage, including Romanian art.

The platform uses **RDF, SPARQL, OWL, SKOS**, and exposes each resource with a unique URL.

## Wiki
All project documentation, deliverables, and progress tracking are available in the [project Wiki](https://github.com/DianaCarcea/Web-Application-Development-PROJECT/wiki).
